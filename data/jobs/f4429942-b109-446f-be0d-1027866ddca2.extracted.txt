Professional Summary
Senior Systems Engineer with 5+ years of experience engineering high-performance automation for complex 5G/6G
testbeds. I specialize in the architectural transition from manual network testing to autonomous, self-optimizing
environments using Python, Agentic AI, and Cloud-Native (K8s/Docker) stacks. My work centers on building the
"internal infrastructure" that solves deep-domain signaling bottlenecks exemplified by my development of NFTRACE
(REST-based tracing) and intelligent remediation engines that achieved 70% auto-resolution of failures. By
blending FastAPI, Redis, and LangChain, I bridge the gap between low-level protocol analysis and high-level
delivery, consistently reducing MTTR by 55% and optimizing pipeline efficiency by 50%.

Work Experience - (5 years Approx)
INFINITE COMPUTER SOLUTIONS (Nokia-Ext) - Python Dev, Automation Tester
(June-2025 to Present)
Nokia In-House Tool - Agentic Ai Module For Autonomous Test Orchestration In 6g Testbeds
● Currently working on a modular agentic AI system that autonomously orchestrates end-to-end test
scenarios in 5G testbeds, self-optimizing based on real-time network telemetry to handle complex
multi-vendor integrations.
LOT3 CCTF TDG GERMANY - UDM/AUSF Testing 5G
● Continued the project and its activities after shifting to infinite
Nokia In-House Tool - Lightweight Pyshark Filter Library for 5G
● Developed a lightweight Python-based Pyshark filter library for automated 5G failure detection and
remediation, integrating into NFTRACE workflows to address signaling errors such as authentication
timeouts, handover disruptions, and congestion reduced manual analysis time from hours to seconds
by curating targeted display filters and real-time monitoring for latency tracking and packet drop alerts.
● Implemented remediation engine with Redis caching for instant suggestions like configuration tweaks
and retries, achieving 70% auto-resolution of routine errors without escalation and a 55% reduction in
mean time to repair (MTTR); boosted core network reliability, resulting in citations in three internal
audits and adoption by operations teams for daily use.
● Led root-cause analysis from logs and audits, identifying that 60% of downtime stemmed from
undetected signaling faults; completed implementation in 2 weeks, including filter curation, monitoring
enhancements, and API hooks for seamless NFTRACE integration, saving hundreds of hours
annually in telecom operations.

Tools: Python | Pyshark | Redis (for filter caching).
NOKIA NETWORKS - Python Dev, Automation Tester (Aug-2022 to June 2025)
LOT3 CCTF TDG GERMANY - UDM/AUSF Testing 5G
● Executed manual functional testing for 5G Core UDM/AUSF, analyzed R&D test specifications to
validate signaling flows, Diameter protocol requirements and subscriber data management scenarios
in live environments.
● Collaborated with client and deployment teams to execute assigned activities within Agile sprints,
ensuring the on-time completion of weekly project deliveries and alignment with production
requirements.
● Managed Kubernetes (K8s) pod health and availability by performing regular health checks and
log analysis to debug microservice behavior, ensuring stable deployment of UDM/AUSF functions.
● Designed a service dashboard for real-time monitoring of active Kubernetes counters and
deployed services, providing the client with clear visibility into cluster health and resource utilization.
● Facilitated daily client communication by building detailed progress reports and providing status
updates on resolved blockers, ensuring alignment with weekly Agile project deliveries.
● Managed high-pressure delivery timelines by providing dedicated technical support during non-office
hours, troubleshooting blockers to maintain project velocity and meet strict deployment schedules.
TCOE - NFTRACE A REST Based Network Function Tracing Tool for Telecom Test
Automation
● Architectured and implemented NFTRACE, a scalable solution for capturing, processing, and
validating PCAP traces in VNF/CNF environments, supporting online, scheduled offline execution
modes to optimize batch testing efficiency by up to 50% in Nokia's Continuous Delivery pipelines.
● Designed server-side components using Python, including REST APIs for trace management
