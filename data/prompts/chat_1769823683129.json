By\nblending FastAPI, Redis, and LangChain, I bridge the gap between low-level protocol analysis and high-level\ndelivery, consistently reducing MTTR by 55% and optimizing pipeline efficiency by 50%.\nCORE COMPETENCIES\nProgramming & Scripting Agentic Ai, Backend & Systems DevOps & Infrastructure:\nLangu\n\nUser prompt:\nwhere is jayaarunkumar from"}
