I specialize in the architectural transition from manual network testing to autonomous, self-optimizing\nenvironments using Python, Agentic AI, and Cloud-Native (K8s/Docker) stacks. My work centers on building the\n\"internal infrastructure\" that solves deep-domain signaling bottlenecks exemplified by my development of NFTRACE\n(REST-based tracing) and intelligent remediation engines that achieved 70% auto-resolution of failures. By\nblending FastAPI, Redis, and LangChain, I bridge the gap between low-level protocol analysis and high-level\ndelivery, consistently reducing MTTR by 55% and optimizing pipeline efficiency by 50%.\nCORE COMPETENCIES\nProgramming & Scripting Agentic Ai, Backend & Systems DevOps & Infrastructure:\nLangu\n\nUser prompt:\nwhat is his current job role"}
